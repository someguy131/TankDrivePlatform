# Goals
The overall goal for this project is to create a large, capable tank drive chassis to be used as a general work-horse robot, keeping modularity in mind.
The requirements to reach this goal are outlined as follows:

  -Have enough torque to move itself and whatever loads may be put on it:
  
    -Trailers
    -Attachments
    -Buckets

  -Be able to traverse basic off road terrain

    -Offroad tires
    -Ground clearance

  -Be durable and weather resistant

    -Skid Plate
    -Enclosed Gearboxes
    -Water resistant electronics

  -Expandable electrical system

    -Power distribution board with extra slots
    -Raspberry Pi head computer controlling an Arduino MEGA 2560 for subsystem controls
